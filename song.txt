It's not enough
I've given up
They're wielding guns
We've been taken over
Uncetain hooves
Let instinct choose
Their every move to leave
Us cornered
I know it's true
Our sweat and blood
And armoured skirts crimson
Story book pretty soldiers
As we grow up
There's nothing left
Bow and arrow in hand
Stand up, follow orders

How cruel have we become
To know what we have done
Tomorrow, another one, "Dear
You're not here."
We watched them leave
Leave our homes - (Forgettable)
We embrace steel and now we know
That we have control

Orient maid, free our souls
(Feel the drums and they hum so loud
Shooting guns from a one man crowd)
Geisha of Blades, wise and cold
(No fun and no love and not proud
What they've done to a lover's home town)

How cruel have I become
To know what I've done
Tomorrow, another, "Dear
You're not here."
And how we feel, no one can know - (Identical)
Our virtues close and personal
So we have control
